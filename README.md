### HeyDayAuburn2020
Script for Oct 14, 2020
During the fall every year since WWII Auburn University has celebrated a unique holiday called Hey Day. This is day that brings the campus closer together, and in order to do this everyone wears name tags to faciliate speaking with others. Because many activities have been switched over to a virtual environment, this program will help celebrate Hey Day without coming into contact with others. If you'd like to learn more about this tradition please follow this link _http://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/_

$ sh heydayscript.sh
